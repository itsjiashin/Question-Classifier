# Question-Classifier
Various deep learning approaches such as DNN, CNN, etc were used to classify questions from the dataset used into 6 coarse question categories, and these include:
- abbreviation (ABBR),
- entity (ENTY),
- description (DESC),
- human (HUM),
- location (LOC) and
- numeric (NUM).

A test accuracy of 98% was obtained on a dataset consisting of 400 questions with the Multi-Head Attention Module implemented within a Transformer.
